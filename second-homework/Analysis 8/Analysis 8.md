## Analysis exercise 8 form group E

This code defines a function called "numJewelsInStones" which takes two arguments: "jewels" and "stones". Both arguments are expected to be strings.

Inside the function, the Counter() method from the collections module is used to create two Counter objects: one for the "jewels" string and another for the "stones" string. The Counter object counts the occurrence of each character in the string.

Then, the function initializes a variable called "kokku" to zero. The function then loops through each character in the "stones" string, checking if that character is present in the "jewels" string. If it is, then the "kokku" variable is incremented by one.

Finally, the function returns the value of "kokku", which represents the number of characters in the "stones" string that are also present in the "jewels" string.

In other words, this function is counting the number of jewels (characters in the "jewels" string) that appear in the "stones" string.

I proposed following changes to the original code:
1. It may be beneficial to add more comments explaining the purpose of each step in the code.
2. The code could benefit from more descriptive function names that reflect their purpose more accurately, even if the code is small and simple.
