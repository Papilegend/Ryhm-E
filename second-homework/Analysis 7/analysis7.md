# **STRING SORTER**

### The code could use error handling in case the input string is not valid. 

If the input contains non-alphanumeric characters or characters that are not letters or digits, the original implementation would not handle them correctly.


The code could benefit from more descriptive function names that reflect their purpose more accurately.


It may be beneficial to add more comments explaining the purpose of each step in the code, especially for those who may not be as familiar with Python.



The comments throughout the code explain the purpose of each function and the steps taken to achieve the desired outcome.

Overall, the code is well organized, easy to understand, and efficient in terms of time and memory complexity.


***I proposed following changes to the original code:***

1) if statement to check whether the input string contains only alphanumeric characters

2) else statement to indicate that the code should proceed as usual if the input string contains only alphanumeric characters

The changes ensure that the input string contains only alphanumeric characters, and if not, prints an error message.
