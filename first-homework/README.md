## Ülesanne 1 - Plus One

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

## Ülesanne 2 - To Camel Case

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

## Ülesanne 3 - Digital Root

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

## Ülesanne 4 - Python if-else

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele

Task
Given an integer n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

**Input Format**

A single line containing a positive integer, .

**Output Format**

Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

## Ülesanne 5 - Write a Function

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele

An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

- The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
  - The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
    - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

**Task**

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

**Input Format**

Read year , the year to test.

**Output Format**

The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

## Ülesanne 6 - Compress the String!

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele

You are given a string S. Suppose a character 'c' occurs consecutively X times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character 'c' with (X, c) in the string.

## Ülesanne 7 - ginortS

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele
You are given a string S. Scontains alphanumeric characters only.
Your task is to sort the string  in the following manner:
- All sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters.
- All sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits.
- All sorted odd digits are ahead of sorted even digits.

## Ülesanne 8 - Jewels and Stones

### Kirjeldus + link ülesandele
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
